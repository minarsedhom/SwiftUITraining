//1- Like before, change the signature so that the method returns a publisher instead of accepting a completion block.
//2- Get a dataTaskPublisher for the image URL.
//3- Use tryMap to check the response code and extract the data if everything is OK.
//4- Use another tryMap operator to change the upstream Data to UIImage, throwing an error if this fails.
//5- Map the error to a GameError.
//6- .eraseToAnyPublisher to return a nice type.
